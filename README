GolfPal android application.

This app is the first assignment in my "Mobile App Development 2" module.

The purpose of this app is to keep track of golf courses that you have played on and also store information on them.
The user can insert a course name, course location, course price, course rating and can also favourite the course.
All data of the courses is stored in a SQLite database.

I used android studio and java to create the app with standard code style.

Throughout the development of the project I have been commiting my progress to github using branches.
The code is available to clone or download at "https://github.com/cormac-dunphy/GolfPal".
When you have the code cloned/downloaded you can run it from android studio.
The app was designed on a Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ so use on another device may affect the performance and general aesthetic of the app.

The apk file for the application is located in the app/release folder.
